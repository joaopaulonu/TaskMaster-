# TaskMaster-

TaskMaster is a robust back-end task management system built on a RESTful API architecture. It provides core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing tasks, along with a secure user authentication system. The project highlights best practices in back-end development, including secure password hashing, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management, and a structured database schema for reliable data storage.
